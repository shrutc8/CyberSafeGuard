'''This code was created by Shrut Chokshi and Darius and in this code these people will have to go through levels that each have a topic surrounding internet safety. Internet safety is a really big problem that is occurring today with the ongoing use of technology. This program is designed to help our target market of kids to learn about internet safety . More information will be provided on all the game demos, slide presentation and research doc. Enjoy the code and work through how to solve these challenges and level. All these levels have a unique and different aspect towards internet safety. Concluding, there will be many opportunities for our users to learn at.
